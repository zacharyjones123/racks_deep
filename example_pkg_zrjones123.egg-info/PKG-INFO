Description: # racks_deep
        This is my project to work with
        
        Sphinx Configuration Notes
        - quickstart-sphinx
        - sphinx-apidoc -o ./doc ./FolderWithpythonFiles
        Then move to the doc file
        - clean html
        - make html
        Note: This took a lot of time to figure out so I saved all of the steps. Hopefully it will be easier from here on out
        ----------------------
        flake8 module
        - use flake8 --statistics
        -- This will give all of the style errors in the files
        ------------------------
        pip freeze > requirements.txt
        -- This will give all of the modules that I have in this project
        (great when working on this on multiple computers)
